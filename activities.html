        <h2>FPDE Research Seminar</h2>
        <p>I have chaired and organized a weekly two-hour seminar on fractional PDEs since Fall 2015. Our research group on fractional PDEs at Brown University is a recipient of a Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) Grant from the U.S. Army Research Office, along with 4 partner groups at other universities.</p>
        <p>I was the primary author and coordinator of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/muri-fractional-pde/home">our group</a>'s recent project on the fractional Laplacian in bounded domains, leading to the submitted manuscript: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09767.pdf">What Is the Fractional Laplacian?</a></p>
        
        <h2>WINR Symposium</h2>
        <p>I co-organized <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/aah/WINRS/index.html">WINRS: A Meeting of Math Minds</a> hosted at Brown University on March 4, 2017. The conference objectives were to introduce students and faculty, in particular women, to ongoing research in New England and bridge gaps between universities. We aimed to connect women in similar mathematical fields, as well as promote collaboration and share strategies for addressing issues facing women and other underrepresented groups in math. The conference was open to everyone, regardless of gender identity. Over the course of one day, the conference featured two plenary lectures, tutorials on encryption, data science, and PDEs, a panel on effective mentoring, an informational lunch meeting for attendees interested in starting an AWM Chapter, and contributed talks and poster sessions. I was one of the four graduate students who helped co-organize the event, and I chaired the first plenary talk and facilitated two tutorials.</p>

        <h2>Brown University AWM Student Chapter</h2>
        <p>
        I served as the AWM Brown Student Chapter President during the 2017-2018 academic year. Our Student Chapter's mission is to support female undergraduate and graduate students, as well as other underrepresented groups in STEM, in their pursuit of academic and professional careers in Mathematics fields. We hold events to engage students in mathematics and provide them with a support network of like-minded students, information about opportunities in mathematics, and informal mentoring events providing advice for successful careers. Please email awm [at] brown.edu for more information.</p>
        <p>In 2017, the Brown University AWM Student Chapter won the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2rXxbFqvn3Zd1dJRHdKYnVXZjg/view">Scientific Excellence</a> award from the Executive Committee of the Association for Women in Mathematics for the WINRS conference we held on March 4, 2017.</p>
                
        <h2>Brown University SIAM Student Chapter</h2>
        <p>The mission of the <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/siam/">Brown SIAM Student Chapter</a> is to develop connections between academic pursuits of students in STEM fields and professional careers in STEM industries. We host events to further this mission, including panel discussions, poster sessions, and social activities.</p>
        <p>I have served on the executive committee and helped organize many of the Chapter activities since Fall 2016.</p>

        <!--<h2>Faculty Graduate Student Liaison</h2>
        <p>Every year, the applied math graduate students elect two to three representatives. Our responsibilities are to orechestrate faculty-grad interactions and communicate any concerns or suggestions that the students have. We are also in charge of holding a budget meeting between all of the graduate student organizations and creating a proposed budget for events, activities, and seminars that the various groups want to hold. I have been a representitive since October 2016.</p>-->
