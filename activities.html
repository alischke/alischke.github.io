        <!--<h2>FPDE Research Group</h2>
        <p>I have chaired and organized a weekly two-hour seminar on fractional PDEs since Fall 2015. Our research group on fractional 
        PDEs at Brown University is a recipient of a Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) Grant from the U.S. 
        Army Research Office, along with four partner groups at other universities.</p>
        <p>I was the primary author and coordinator of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/muri-fractional-pde/home">our group</a>'s recent project on the fractional Laplacian in bounded domains, leading 
        to the submitted manuscript: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09767.pdf">What Is the Fractional Laplacian?</a></p>-->
        
        <h2>MATLAB Software Engineering Internship</h2>
        <p>I worked on an exploratory project for the MATLAB Math team at MathWorks, Natick, MA during Summer 2019. I learned about randomized matrix algorithms for computing low-rank approximations, and I developed 
        an algorithm for computing a low-rank approximate SVD of a general input matrix. The algorithm is currently in use internally at MATLAB and will be available for public use in MATLAB 2020b.</p>
        
        <h2>WINR Symposium</h2>
        <p>I co-organized <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/aah/WINRS/index.html">WINRS: A Meeting of Math Minds</a> hosted 
          at Brown University on March 4, 2017. The conference objectives were to introduce students and faculty, in particular 
          women, to ongoing research in New England and bridge gaps between researchers at different universities. We aimed to 
          connect women in similar mathematical fields, as well as promote collaboration and share strategies for addressing issues 
          facing women and other underrepresented groups in math. The conference was open to everyone, regardless of gender identity. 
          Over the course of one day, the conference featured two plenary lectures, tutorials on encryption, data science, and PDEs, 
          a panel on effective mentoring, an informational lunch meeting for attendees interested in starting an AWM Chapter, and 
          contributed talks and poster sessions. I was one of the four graduate students who helped co-organize and run the event.</p>

        <h2>Brown University AWM Student Chapter</h2>
        <p>
        I served as the AWM Brown Student Chapter President during the 2017-2018 academic year. Our Student Chapter's mission is to support female undergraduate and graduate students, as well as other underrepresented groups in STEM, in their pursuit of academic and professional careers in Mathematics fields. We hold events to engage students in mathematics research and provide them with a support network of like-minded students, information about opportunities in mathematics, and informal mentoring events providing advice for successful careers. Please email awm [at] brown.edu for more information.</p>
        <p>In 2017, the Brown University AWM Student Chapter won the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2rXxbFqvn3Zd1dJRHdKYnVXZjg/view">Scientific Excellence award</a> from the Executive Committee of the Association for Women in Mathematics for the WINRS conference we held on March 4, 2017.</p>

        <h2>Brown University SIAM Student Chapter</h2>
        <p>The mission of the <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/siam/">Brown SIAM Student Chapter</a> is to develop connections between academic pursuits of students in STEM fields and professional careers in STEM industries. We host events to further this mission, including panel discussions, poster sessions, and social activities.</p>
        <p>I have served on the executive committee and helped organize many of the Chapter activities since Fall 2016.</p>
